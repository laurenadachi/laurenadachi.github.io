### Team Projects
<p> I've worked on the BSE and Pufferfish ventilation team repositories:
  <ul>
      <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/pez-globo">Pufferfish Ventilation (Pez Globo)</a>:
              I worked on the
                  <a href="https://github.com/pez-globo/pufferfish-electronics/tree/interface"> interface PCB </a>
              where I created the electronics interface between front-end user devices and the control MCU.
      </li>
      <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/BrownSpaceEngineering">Brown Space Engineering:</a>
          My team and I are initial stages of developing the PCBs for our newest satellite. The majority
          of our current work is research and overall systems design--stay posted for hardware updates!
      </li>
  </ul>
